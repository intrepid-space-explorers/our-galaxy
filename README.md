# Life Out There

Our universe is an amazing place full of amazing things.  Stars and planets surround us in all directions, Earth is just one small world in a great, vast cosmos.  Out latest estimates are that the Milky Way galaxy contains between 200 and 400 billion stars, most of which probably also have planets, and there are at least 100 billion galaxies in the universe.  Are we alone in the universe?  Are we the only people looking up at the night sky and wondering if anyone else is out there?

The answer to that question is almost definitely, "No!"

Clearly, there is someone out there wondering about us too.

This program is a model to help demonstrate the rarity (or not) of life evolving around other stars in our galaxy.
