# Group Agreement  
  
We as team Intrepid Space Explorers agree to the following.  
  
We will have merge parties three times a day: morning, lunch, and end of work day. This way we are all working with up to date code as much as possible.  
  
Our work day is set to 9am - 5pm. There is no expectation of working outside of these hours. If someone chooses to work after hours that is perfectly acceptable, however it is 100% a personal choice.  
  
If we are working on something (mainly afterhours), we will slack the group so that we don't end up doing conflicting work.  
  
We will check slack once during the evening, just in case something comes up. But there is no expectation of being available afterhours.  
  
Daily review of progress/issues as a group at end of day.  
  
We will use snake case for our naming.  
  
  
### Conflict management:  
  
Full transparency about potential issues. Discuss it even if it seems silly or small so that things don't turn into unexpectedly big deals.  
  
If someone needs to step away for *any* reason, all they have to do is say 'albatross' and take a break/step away absolutely no strings attached/no hard feeilngs.  
  
Jon has mediation/conflict resolution experience and has offered to help resolve anything that comes up.  
  
If we truely hit a stand still on what direction to go, we will decide with a game of ping-pong, winner get to decide.
