    <h1>Searching the Cosmos...</h1>
    <h2>What will you find?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="indexInstructions">
    <p>Our universe is an amazing place full of amazing things.&nbsp; Stars and planets surround us in all directions, Earth is just one small world in a great, vast cosmos.&nbsp; Out latest estimates are that the Milky Way galaxy contains betwwen 200 and 400 billion stars, most of which probably also have planets, and there are at least 100 billion galaxies in the universe.&nbsp; Are we alone in the universe?&nbsp; Are we the only people looking up at the night sky and wondering if anyone else is out there?</p>
    <p>The answer to that question is almost definitely, "No!"</p>
    <!-- <p>In such a tremendously large place, the odds of life evolving somewhere else is a certainty.&nbsp; The real question then is not "Are we alone" but "Where are they?" </p> -->
    <!-- <p>This question can be explored via something called The Drake Equation.&nbsp; Created in 1961 by Dr. Frank Drake, the equation proposes a series of variables to determine the likelihood of intelligent life evolving on a planet.&nbsp; Some of the variables in the orginal equation are known and some are disputed.V&nbsp; Alternative formulae have been proposed, but the one common factor in all versions is the attempt to quantity the factors that could allow inteligent life to develop.</p> -->
    <!-- <p>The reverse of these calculations can show how <i>unlikely</i> it is that Earth is the only planet in the universe to harbor intelligent life.&nbsp; Factoring in the number of stars and planets in the known universe and the number of years since the Big Bang, the odds that Earth is the <i>only</i> planet to evolve intelligence in the whole universe are an incredible less than 2.5×10−24 agaisnt (that's a decimal point followed by 24 zeros then 25!).&nbsp; Even if we just look inside the Milky Way galaxy, for Earth to host the only civilization for all time, the odds must be less than 1.7×10−11 (about 1 in 60 billion).</p> -->
    <p>Clearly, there is someone out there wondering about us too.</p>
    <p>This program is a model to help demonstrate the rarity (or not) of life evolving around other stars in our galaxy.</p>
