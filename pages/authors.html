                            OLD <br>
                            Jon is a retired US Air Force officer who started programming back when dinosaurs walked the Earth.  His first computer was a black and white monitor attached to a keyboard with an audio cassette deck for external storage that had a massive 16 kilobytes of RAM.  He remembers punch cards "fondly" and sadly knows BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, RPL, Assembler, and a whole bunch of other code that was obsolete before most of you were born.  Jon also is an author, painter, photographer, inventor, and public speaker on top of being the President of the International Association of Astronomical Artists (www.iaaa.org).
